1. Create the web application locally by using the ASP.NET Core Web App .NET project template with `dotnet new mvc -n inlamningsuppgift_1`. It uses the Model-view-controller architectural pattern, which separation of concerns makes it easy to divide development of large complex applications between several developers[*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/overview/asp-net-mvc-overview#advantages-of-an-mvc-based-web-application). It also uses the client-server model where the ASP.NET Core application is the server, and the browser, which renders Razor views, act as client.
2. Create a "src" directory in the project directory, and move everything into it.
3. Edit the `src/Views/Home/Index.cshtml` file and add your name after "Welcome" in the heading tag.
4. Open the link provided in the output in step 1, in a browser and verify that your name is visible on the home page.
